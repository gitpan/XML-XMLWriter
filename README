XML::XMLWriter version 0.1
============================

XMLWriter is a Perl 5 object class, its purpose is to make writing XML
documents easier, cleaner, safer and standard conform. Its easier
because of the object oriented way XML documents are written with
XMLWriter. Its cleaner because of the simple but logical API and its
safe and standard conform because of the automatically done checking
against the the DTD.

But still: it might be a matter of taste whether one finds XMLWriter
usefull or not and it probably has some bugs (i would appreciate a lot
if you report them to me), many usefull features are missing, not
implemented or not even thought of and perhaps the API with all its
simpleness might be confusing though. So please tell me your opinion
and tell me the way how you would make XMLWriter better. Its not so
easy to develop a good API for this matter.

XMLWriter contains 3 packages: XMLWriter.pm which gives you the
document object, Element.pm which provides the element/tag objects and
PCData.pm which represents the parsed character data the document
contains. There'll probably come more objects in feature releases.
The most interesting class is Element.pm. It provides some methods you
can call on every document element, but besides those methods it uses
the AUTOLOAD feature of perl to expect every not known method name
to be the name of a tag that should be added to the list of child tags
of the element the method is called on. So calling "$html->head"
will simply add a new element (the head element) to the list of child
tags of the html element. The head object is returned.  Have a look at
the examples for better understanding. You should also read the POD of
Element.pm and PCdata.pm.

Please see the POD for additional information.
